The user changes their addons locally, and wants to upload to the cloud.
-> Git push which will upload users changes.

The user is on a different computer and wants to download their addons from the cloud.
-> Git pull and copy addons to local.

Workflow
--------
Git pull first. This will ensure latest changes from the repo. Check the dates of local files.
If the dates are modified before the date of the remote changes, overwrite local with remote.
Otherwise if the local dates are modified after the date of the remote changes,
say there is a conflict and ask if you'd like to use remote as the source of truth or local as the source of truth.
If local, copy local to git and push. If remote, copy git pulled folder to local.
